Excellent! Committing your project to GitHub is a crucial step. Since you have your frontend and backend in separate folders (client and server) within a main project directory, the best approach is to manage them together in a single GitHub repository. This is called a monorepo.

Here is the step-by-step guide to do it correctly.

Step 1: Create a .gitignore File (Very Important!)
This is the most critical step. A .gitignore file tells Git which files and folders to ignore. You must ignore the node_modules folders in both your client and server directories, as they are huge and can be reinstalled by anyone who clones your project.

Go to your root project folder (the one that contains client and server).

Create a new file named exactly .gitignore (with the dot at the beginning).

Copy and paste the following content into it. This is a standard .gitignore for a MERN stack project.

# Dependencies
/node_modules
/client/node_modules

# Production build folders
/client/build

# Log files
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# IDE and OS files
.idea
.vscode
*.suo
*.ntvs*
*.njsproj
*.sln
*.sw?
.DS_Store
